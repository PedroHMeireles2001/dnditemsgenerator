## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflict (3000 or 5000)

**Issue:** If you encounter a port conflict, it might be because another application is already using ports 3000 or 5000.

**Solution:** Ensure that no other applications are using these ports. You can either stop the conflicting application.

### Invalid OpenAI API Key

**Issue:** If you see errors related to an invalid API key, it means your OpenAI API key might be incorrect or expired.

**Solution:** Double-check your `.env` file to ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correct. If needed, obtain a new API key from the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

### Insufficient OpenAI API Credits

**Issue:** If you encounter errors related to insufficient credits, it means your OpenAI API key doesn't have enough credits.

**Solution:** Verify your credit balance on the [OpenAI Pricing](https://beta.openai.com/pricing) page and replenish credits if necessary.
